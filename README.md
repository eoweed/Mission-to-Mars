# Mission-to-Mars
Webscraping for data about space travel to Mars

## Overview:
###### The purpose of this project is to create a Flask app that will scrape Mars data from four websites and consolidate the information into one webpage. The app grabs a featured article showing the latest news, a featured image, facts about Mars, and images of Mars hemispheres. Below is a screenshot of the app.
